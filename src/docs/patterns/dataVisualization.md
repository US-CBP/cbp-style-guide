<h3>Data Visualization</h3>

It is sometimes important to communicate detailed information to users visually. This increases content digestion while simultaneously making page content more engaging. The primary goal of this effort is to make information more intellectually distinct, not more decorative.

When bold shapes and contrasted colors are used with responsive actions, users have increased comprehension.

#### Usage

You can bring increased clarity to your information by considering your page layout early on. We advise against having more than 3 graphical elements on one page.

Avoid showing more than four distinct colors in any one chart. Use grey tones to represent inactive or supporting metrics.

- Line Graphs
- Bullet Chart
- Pie Chart
- Avoid using a pie chart if your information will be sliced in to 10 or more pieces.
